// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(list integer 1 to 10
if integer =1,3,5,7,9 print odd
else if integer =2,4,6,8,10 print even)


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


( list integer 1 to 5.
print integer list a.
loop integer list a
if 1+2+3+4+5 = print as sum.
loop sum / 5 = print as average.
loop integer list a 
if integer = 1 print Mininum
else if = 5  print Maximum
loop integer list a = data set
if integer = "average" print average value
if integer = minimum, maximum print range
print "pseudo math code")
